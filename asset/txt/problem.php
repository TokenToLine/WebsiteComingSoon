<h2>Problem solving</h2>
<p>The biggest problem in the
    crypto market today is security
    and fairness. There are many
    coins that you cannot trust due to
    rugpulls and market manipulation.</p>

<p>We want to solve this by showing all
    our work and codes to the user.
    In addition, we explain what the
    code does so that users with little
    understanding still understand it.</p>
