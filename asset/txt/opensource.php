<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Openness and honesty are very
important to us, which is why we are a
fully open source company. Any code
you use as a customer can be viewed
on our github page. Think, for example,
of the solidity contract, website and the
discordbot.</p>

<p>Some parts of codes have been omitted.
We do this for security reasons and
private data such as your e-mail address.
What is omitted here could be the
following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Passwords and connections
    with applications that require an
    account.</li>
    <li>Database connections.</li>
    <li>Database data</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>Private keys</li>
</ul>
