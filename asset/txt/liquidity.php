<h2>Liquidity pool</h2>
<p>5% of every trade is invested in the liquidity pool.
	This ensures that the token can process larger amounts.</p>
<p>We automatically burn our lp tokens so
    that the ratio in our liquidity pool always
    remains the same. This keeps the price
    stable and it would not be possible to
    manipulate the market.</p>
